        <h1> Dem Damn Dams </h1>
        <p> If we had done less, we wouldn't have to do more to do less again 
            -- the removal of exisiting dams costs hundreds of millions of dollars 
            and fish hatchery projects cause irreparable harm to the genetic variation 
            of natural salmon species.
        </p>
        <h4> No one stopped to think if we should build dams on these important rivers.</h4>
        <h4> No one stopped to think if we should try to artificially recreate the fish ourselves.</h4>

        <p> The budget requests $239.3 million, $2.2 million
            less than the 2024 CR amount, to support the
            National Fish Hatchery System, aquatic habitat
            conservation and restoration, and the prevention
            and control of aquatic invasive species. That
            amount includes $80.3 million for operation of
            the National Fish Hatchery System and $32.1
            million for National Fish Hatchery maintenance,
            $3.9 million and $5.8 million, respectively, more
            than the 2024 CR amount. 
        </p>
        <h4> And now we are paying hundreds of millions for fish that, unfortunately, 
            are also making the problem worse by destroying the genetic makeup of the natural salmon.  </h4>
